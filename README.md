###Milestone 2 Feedback
Good job on Milestone 2. Your code is looking good, and all requirements have been met. Your Milestone 2 passes at Tier III.
 
##Suggestions
- Explore gallery plugins. [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/) might be an option for you.

##Corrections
- Be sure to end your character escape codes with a ';' (&lt&#59; For Example &gt&#59;)
- &lt;img&gt; tags on lines 54 and 58 are missing the closing "&gt;".
- Keep code indented properly for organization and readability.

###Milestone 3 Feedback
Your mobile wireframes are missing, but overall great job on Milestone 3. Your M.S. passes at Tier II. 
 
##Suggestions
- Explore gallery plugins. [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/)
- Take a look at Bootstrap's [Carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel), and [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar).
- Look into creating your ninja star shapes using SVG. You can also incorporate text inside SVG images.

##Corrections
- Container &lt;div&gt; is missing the closing tag.

###Milestone 4 Feedback
- On the services page, the image doesn't work so well on mobile. There are a couple of ways around this... but I had a thought - perhaps for xs and sm screens, we just have plain text content, and only load the image on md and large screens. This can be done really easily using Bootstrap's Responsive Utilities to show and hide content: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities
- There appears to be a couple of slides and som resources that aren't loading on my end... double check all references to your resources to be sure that they load right.
- I see that you've used a plugin called the Super Simple Slider for your home page graphics. I've taken a look at the docs, and adding nav arrows should be a snap by setting some options in a custom js file. See the options section: http://supersimpleslider.com/
- Awesome job. This looks great so far!
