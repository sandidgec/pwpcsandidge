		<h2> Ninja Purpose  </h2>
		<p> The purpose of my website is to offer a web presence for myself to showcase my web and graphic design
			skills in a one-stop shop web experience.
		</p>

		<h2> Audience</h2>
			<p> The audience for my portfolio website will be potential employers and clients who want to
			explore content I have previously worked on and participated in. The website will showcase work in
			a simplified and professional manner that will allow the user to dig deeper if they want to see
			the depth of the work posted on the website and it will allow the casual site visitor a quick snap-shot
			of the content as it relates to my professional skills and technical attributes.</p>
		<h2> The Goal for &ltdesignByNinja&gt</h2>
			<p>The main goal for this website is to serve as a professional business card that can be referenced to
			when meeting potential clients or employers. The website will also serve a secondary goal in allowing me
			to experiment with design ideas and coding techniques. </p>
		<h2> User Persona </h2>
			<p> Kevin (User Persona)- Kevin is the owner of a small web design firm and is looking to bring in another
			employee to his growing company. He recently met Charles at a networking event and from his business card
			got the address to his webpage with his portfolio on it. Wanting to see what kind of work Charles has done in
			the past, Kevin visited the website and browsed the portfolio. </p>
		<h2> Use Case</h2>
			<ul>
			<li> Kevin points his browser toward www.designByNinja.com</li>
			<li> By viewing the clean design he is able to quickly navigate to the "Portfolio" section.</li>
			<li> He browses the website samples in front of him and then Navigates to the contact page.</li>
			<li> An easy to use form allows Kevin to send a message to Charles to give him a call to discuss
			employment opportunities.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2> The Plan</h2>
			<p>The plan for designByNinja.com is to layout and structure the site in an easy navigate style that also
		showcases some cool designs and "tricks". Then the site will be populated with portfolio worthy designs and
		links to outside work.</p>
