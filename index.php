		<h2> Ninja Purpose  </h2>
		<p> The purpose of my website is to offer a web presence for myself to showcase my web and graphic design
			skills in a one-stop shop web experience.
		</p>

		<h2> Audience</h2>
		<p> The audience for my portfolio website will be potential employers and clients who want to
			explore content I have previously worked on and participated in. The website will showcase work in
			a simplified and professional manner that will allow the user to dig deeper if they want to see
			the depth of the work posted on the website and it will allow the casual site visitor a quick snap-shot
			of the content as it relates to my professional skills and technical attributes.</p>
		<h2> The Goal for &ltdesignByNinja&gt</h2>
		<p>The main goal for this website is to serve as a professional business card that can be referenced to
			when meeting potential clients or employers. The website will also serve a secondary goal in allowing me
			to experiment with design ideas and coding techniques.
